## Finally! Here it is!
Excited!!

Finally, wrapped up the ‚ÄúCode with Mosh-The ultimate HTML 5 & CSS 3 series provided by Mosh Hamedani‚Äù. I must recommend this to every beginner who ever thinks of starting their coding career in web development. So, in the last course, we developed a website and it was a walk along the course, where each and every step was specified very clearly. Discussing the main points which seemed important to me in the subsequent points.

1.**Playground:** When we are developing a large project, it is quite natural to have some errors and issues which need attention. To avoid wastage time, we create a new HTML and for the fun, we name it playground and then inspect the playground.html and figure out the mistakes.

2.**Animations**: We can add animations and many are available online website named, AOS. GitHub link we can add it in the head element and play around with many animations.

3.**Search engine optimization**: To make your website step out from the rest of the websites, it is quite important to write a suitable title and description of the page.   
4.**HTML and CSS validation**: It is quite important to know that the script that we have written follows the rule of every browser. We can use online websites and upload our script to know the errors and warnings.

5.**Building for production**: Before deploying, we need to build process which helps in combining CSS and JS files, minifies CSS and JS files, and optimizes the images. There are many build tools online namely WebPack, Rollup, and Parcel among many. Out of which parcel being the most prioritised. 

And finally, with many ups and downs, I was able to deploy my website using **Netlify**!
