I'm excited to talk about my experience at **Ryaz**, a company that helps businesses connect to the global market by creating the most dynamic and creative websites. My dearest senior, "Palak Thapar," who inspires me and many others, introduced me to Ryaz.

So, this journey begin with a **“get on-board”** general interview and we were assigned our mentors. I got under the mentorship of Amanjot sir, and fortunately, he was so humble to he listened to me very patiently during the first meet which was a virtual meet and greet to make me familiar with the working of the company and motivated me to give my best and learn the maximum from during these six months. 

And by this, my journey started at RYAZ on **January 11, 2023.**

We started with the training on January 13, 2023, and my mentor assigned me to be well-versed with the fundamentals of the web, For which he suggested me go through the course **“Code with Mosh-The ultimate HTML 5 & CSS 3 series provided by Mosh Hamedani.** There are three courses that have a number of sub-sections. I started with the first part which discussed web development fundamentals, HTML Basics, and CSS basics and course II till Layouts. 

This is what is done until January 16, 2023
