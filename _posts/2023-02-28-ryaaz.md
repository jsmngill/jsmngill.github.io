## It didn’t come out as expected

Hello techies, as told in the preceding blog about my task of cloning the google meer interface. It seemed easy to me when I saw the screen and developed an idea about how it could be done. But to achieve perfection I thought of using INSPECT so I can develop everything pixel-perfect! But little did I know google had its own ways that’s why it’s called ***THE GOOGLE***. Many things were encrypted and I was unable to find any element and some other properties of g-meet.

Currently, I made the main page of the interface which includes the mic, user profile picture, and user-name which seems nowhere near perfect. Furthermore, I have prepared some elements of the footer but due to the hard core of the height and width I am not able to see those elements. Currently, just trying to figure out the issues and it’s been two days on this project and after two days I need to submit it to the mentor. 

Let’s see what’s next to unfold!!
