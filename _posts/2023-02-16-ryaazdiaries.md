A Month Already!

I completed a month of writing my blogs on GitHub pages, I enjoy coming back and reading them, hopeful to keep this habit of writing with me forever and eventually make it a ritual. 

Continuing our previous blog, today I worked on the body element of the website and completed it. It was too satisfying to see the design very close to the actual one! But there were times when I was struck with the hurdles and issues which would be discussed in the later discussion. The one thing that I realized while doing this assignment was that in computing you need not be rote all the concepts because google is a proven best friend of all programmers, particularly the website called **“Stack Overflow”**. Another cool tip in this blog would be the [site](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/), which is used to convert the .svg file from the live website to the usable image form for our website, which becomes important when you are cloning a website where you are not given any .svg items but need to manage all by yourself. 

Coming on the issues(silly mistakes as well) and solutions to the problems which I encountered while developing.

1. There was a time when the elements were **overlapping** each other, to which I gave them a defined height due to which they were filled in the container and the problem       of overlapping got eliminated. 
2. **Margin: auto** was another thing that was used most of the time while developing this website.
3. Be very careful when adding the style of the **name of the class**, if it has some alphabetic mistake, the design won’t get applied until you type the right name of the       class
4. If something needs to be applied to priority biases, we can use **“!important”** after the property. 
    For Example, margin-top:10px !important;

The remaining tasks are the footer and navbar, moreover making the website responsive for all sizes. 

That was all for the fine day!
