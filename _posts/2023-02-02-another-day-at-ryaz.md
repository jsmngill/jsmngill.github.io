## Programmers, learn by doing!
***“Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it.”
– Patrick McKenzie***

Today, was the day to test the skills which were learned by me through the course, my mentor provided me with a design from Figma to make a clone of the **Apple iWatch landing page design**. I don’t have much to share in this blog, but just my progress. So, currently, I am done with the desktop version, which some issues in padding yet to be addressed. And now I am all set to work on the responsiveness of the website, which again has some issues which need my attention. I have very carefully divided the website into parts, suggested by my dear friend, **Blossom** which actually worked out. I was stuck at the vertical sidebar for almost two days, but the mistake I was doing was very little and now when I look back I just feel ashamed of doing that “silliest” mistake. 

In nutshell, the issues are briefed in the subsequent section:

1.**Vertical sidebar**, was a huge issue as I was not able to figure out how to make it, but eventually succeeded after spending a lot of time on the same. 

2.**Responsiveness** is yet another issue. I am using the flex property and when I am adding the media query and changing the flex-direction to the column, the elements of the divs are overlapping each other, need to figure out why?

3.**Navigation drop down** This is pending as of now and will complete after I resolve the aforementioned issues.

That was all for my two days, will share the final website as soon as I complete it. Hopefully, the next blog also will provide the solutions to the above-mentioned problems. 
Personal take: I think coding always maximizes your patience level as you fail a number of times, but still never give up. 
Always remember, Programmers, learn by doing!

Until we meet again, virtually!
