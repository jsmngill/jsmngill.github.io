## Basic Information about mobile-first
Mobile-first is an approach to web design and development that involves designing and developing websites for mobile devices first, and then scaling up to larger screens such as tablets and desktops.

To create a mobile-first version of a website using CSS and HTML, you will need to design your layout with smaller screens in mind, and then gradually enhance it for larger screens using media queries.

The advantages of using the mobile-first are:

**Faster page loading**: Since mobile devices have limited resources and slower internet connections, designing for mobile first allows for faster page loading on mobile devices. This is because only the necessary styles are loaded for smaller screens, reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded.

**Improved user experience**: Mobile-first design forces us to prioritize the most important elements of your website or application, making it easier for users to find what they need. This approach also allows you to design for touchscreens and other mobile-specific features, which can improve the overall user experience.

**Easier maintenance**: When you start with a mobile-first approach, we create a solid foundation for our design that can be easily scaled up for larger screens. This makes it easier to maintain your code and update it in the future.

The only difference which occurs is that we use min-width instead of max width for this kind of display. 
To reiterate, the key to creating a mobile-first version of a website is to start with a simple, focused layout and gradually enhance it for larger screens using media queries and flexible layouts. By taking a mobile-first approach, you can ensure that your website is accessible and usable on a variety of devices, from small smartphones to large desktop monitors.
