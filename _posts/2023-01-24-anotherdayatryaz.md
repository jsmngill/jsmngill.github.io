## Let's make websites and commit mistakes together!
Hello Again,

Finally, I reached the last part of “Code with Mosh-The ultimate HTML 5 & CSS 3 series provided by Mosh Hamedani” and am now working on making the dynamic website. It is said it’s never done until you do it yourself, getting involved actively in the course counts and develops an interest in the field you are working in. So, here I am to share my voyage in creating the website. In web development, it is always suggested to follow the bottom-up approach, we should start developing the components first, instead of the layout directly as, we will get into the mess and won’t be able to find our mistakes if we follow the top-down approach. While developing you come across various new things which eventually get imprinted in your mind forever, when you spend some time to find a solution to the problem. Here are a few of my problems and new things which I learned during this course(although still in the mid-way of the course):

1.**GitHub setup**: I am choosing the vs code as my code editor, it is quite easy to push your code and progress in your GitHub account using a few simple steps. Follow this link for the same [GitHub Setup in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github).

2.**A cool tip**: if we want to work on multiple lines and want to add the same code, we can do that in one go by pressing “Ctrl+Alt+Down”.

3.**Beware!** Spellings mistake is often made in the files which result in a non-satisfactory output.

4.**Properties invalid**:Width and Height properties do not apply to inline property for example span.

5.**Flex**:To apply the flex properties, we need to change the display to inline-flex.

6.**Anither Button**:There is another great type of button, called the block button which gives the full-fedge length to the button.

7.**Hover**:Whenever we need to make the hover changes to an element by changing it’s color to little bit lighter than the original color we can write the code 
```
“Hover: lighten(primary,10%);”
```
8.**Media Query**:Media Query is used in making the responsive website and for the maximum time the min-width is 1024px;

9.**My Mistake**:The most silliest yet common mistake during this half course: The comments in HTML is done via:
```
<!--comment–> 
```
and in CSS it is:
```
/*comment*/
```

This was all to share for these few days!

Until next time.
