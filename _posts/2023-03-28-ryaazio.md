## SneakPeak into JS Operators

I got my hands on the JavaScript operators in the past two days. Honestly, the properties werenâ€™t that new for me as I am pretty aware of the primary programming languages but something quite cool was **commenting out multiple lines** in a go in JS and the key is to select the multiple lines and then control and backslash(/), and we are good to goooooo!!
Coming back to the operators the first and basic thing is operands and operators, operands are the values or variables that are operated upon by operators in an expression and operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values or variables.There are several types of operators in JavaScript: 

1. **Arithmetic operators**: These operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on numbers. Examples include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation (**).
```
let x=30;
let y=2;
console.log(x+y);
console.log(x-y);
console.log(x*y);
console.log(x/y);
console.log(x%y);
console.log(x**y);
//Increment(++)
console.log(++x);
console.log(x++);
// console.log(x);
//Decrement(--)
console.log(--x);
console.log(x--);
console.log(x);
```
2. **Assignment operators**: These operators are used to assign values to variables. 
```
let r =100;
x++;
x=x+1;
```
More of it are minus-equal (-=), multiplication-equal (*=), division-equal (/=), and modulus-equal (%=) operators.

3.**Comparison operators**: These operators are used to compare values. Examples include equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).
```
let j=3;
console.log(j>0);
```
4. **Equality Operator**: Generally, we have the equality sign as(==) in many programming languages but javaScript is a bit different it has two types of equality one being strict equality (===) which compares both type and value whereas loose equality only compares the value.

5. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**: This operator is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement. It takes three operands: a condition, an expression to be evaluated if the condition is true, and an expression to be evaluated if the condition is false. The syntax is: 
condition? expression1 : expression2.
For Example:
```
//If a customer has more than 100 points, then the customer is a GOLD customer otherwise SILVER
let points=110;
let type= points >100 ? 'gold': 'silver';
console.log(type);
```

6. **Logical Operators**: These are used to combine two or more Boolean expressions and return a Boolean result. It includes && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT).
Example:
**Logical AND(&&)**:Returns TRUE if both operands are TRUE
```
 console.log(true && true);
 console.log(true && false);
 let HighIncome= true;
 let goodCredit=true;
 let loanPass=HighIncome&&goodCredit;
 console.log(loanPass)
 ```
 
**Logical OR(||)**:Returns TRUE if one of the operands are TRUE
```
let HighIncome= true;
let goodCredit=true;
let loanPass=HighIncome||goodCredit;
console.log(loanPass);
```

That is all for the operators!!

Keep Learninggg!!
