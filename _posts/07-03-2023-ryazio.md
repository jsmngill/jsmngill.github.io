## Portfolio Clone from FIGMA

**Don’t be discouraged when taking up a challenging task that may appear you’re ‘unqualified’ for. Programmers learn by doing!**

As mentioned in the previous blog, I started to clone the website of portfolio from the Figma [website](https://www.figma.com/file/gKZoWoleFgP35xvYu83Y2l/Portfolio-UI---Web-%26-Mobile?node-id=6%3A52&t=Wcal9e3pCEdvQvuY-0), it can be accessed using this link. In this, I first started with the layout of the website. 

By carefully examining the layout, the website is divided into five components that need different execution. 

Started working on the very first component that was navbar on the first day of allotment. Since I had to do the mobile version first which I struggled a lot with doing as I was habitual of doing the desktop version first always but it’s said you need to come out of your comfort zone to achieve something and nourish yourself in every aspect. The navbar looked completely different for both versions. For that, I had to make two different division tags so that I can make display none when the particular component is not required. As the navbar needs to be right aligned so I used the float property for the same. Moreover, as I mentioned to do the mobile version first so, the media query that was added was “min-width: 600px”.

It was all for day 1.

Until Next time,

~J Gill.
