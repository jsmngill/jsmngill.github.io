## A day in the life of developer
The last week was full of roller coster ride.

Things got up and down along with the application. 
I am almost done with my front end, which I developed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
Still the most imprtant part is on the stake.. **"Integration of API"**

Strugling to get the API for Dall-E. Since the portal shows no more free trails avaiable. So decided t set up the paid account, In order to get my project ready within a day or two.

After getting the paid account, still it showed no image.. Until my mentor came for the rescue.. 
He played a trick and the image was there..
Haha! Not exactly this he debugged my super confusing code and got the image genration process working!

So the current progress report is that I am almost done with setting up my project. Now moving onto the next part of making up the gallery!!

Until we meet again!!
