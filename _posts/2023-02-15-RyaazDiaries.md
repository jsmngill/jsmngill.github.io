## Cloning Skriper!
***‚ÄúProgramming isn‚Äôt about what you know; it‚Äôs about what you can figure out.‚Äù

Long time, no see!

So, In the previous blogs, I wrote about my assignment, which took longer than expected but is acceptable as I am a newbie. After writing the code almost three times, the satisfaction I got after getting my design approved was unmatchable. So, now my mentor wants me to headstart the training in a more competitive yet better way! So, he asked me to clone the [skriper] (https://skriper.dev/) website.

And it began!

1. First and foremost, I inspected the design by myself and drew a rough sketch using a pen and paper, and decided about the layouts that I would be using to make the website. There are many ways in which we can make our websites like using divs, flex, grids, and more.

2. Moving further, I made a repository in GitHub, so that I can host my website on netlify side by side.
 
3. Then I divided the websites into parts and decided to work on the body element first, which had three more subparts. 

4. For the first day, I was able to complete ‚Öì of the body element.

5. Then my mentor asked me to make separate PRs(pull requests), for every component I work on so that he can keep checking on the progress and can point out the mistakes.
  
6. But, accidentally I pushed to code into the master branch only (which is the default), through VS code. üò¢

After doing the task I realized that **our problem-solving abilities in coding matter more than our knowledge base**. Following any greatest instructor can show you the path to follow, but can‚Äôt walk alongside fighting with your hurdles, that's what you do for yourself and gain experience. Reminder **the harder you fall, the higher you bounce!** Never get discouraged while doing any job.

P.S: This is what, even I need to implement on my life! :upside_down_face:

This was all for the day! 


Would be discussing my progress through blogs daily! 

Until then mates, Keep Coding and progressing!
