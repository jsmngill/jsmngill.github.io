## Working on the components
**"Programming isn’t about what you know; it’s about what you can figure out."**

Currently, is day 2 of doing the portfolio exercise. Today I targeted to complete the intro part and the recent post-task. 

So, I first started off with the introduction part, I downloaded all the necessary stuff to kick-start it. For the mobile version, the image needs to come first. So, I applied the flex display as I find it very convenient to use the flexbox which I found very difficult but now I am habitual to it. Then for the desktop, I got confused and got stuck for a while as firstly, I was able to see the image and then the content on the right side which needs to be vice-versa. 

After a break, something knocked my mind that we can always use the flex-direction as row-reverse, and holaaaa it was done. After that, with the necessary changes in margin and padding, it was done. 

Moving further to the recent post, it went smoothly until I was the alignment of the recent post and view all. And until the day end, I was not able to fix this. I tried using margin and padding but when in responsiveness it gets messed up. 
Let’s see how it goes
