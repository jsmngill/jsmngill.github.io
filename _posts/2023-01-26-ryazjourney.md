## Website development is fun!
Another day another story!!
As mentioned earlier that I am on course 3 of  ‚ÄúCode with Mosh-The ultimate HTML 5 & CSS 3 series provided by Mosh Hamedani‚Äù. All the concepts that I have covered in the last two parts were used practically in this course, with a lot of mistakes and new discoveries I am ultimately working towards accomplishing my website. I am on part 30/46 and by the end of this week, I will be able to finish and deploy it somewhere. So, the new things I learned until now are discussed below:

1. **Callouts v/s Card**: Card has a header with the background color whereas the callouts have no shadow and the part is entirely colored. 
2. **Justify-items**:It applies to the grid whereas justify-self applies to the grid items and by default they are horizontal. 
3. **Collapsable component**: Collapsable component has two sections one is the header which has the heading and icon along with the body or the content area. 
4. **Appending Javascript**: we can always use a <script src="main.js"></script> to append the javascript.
5. **Animation**: Animation is yet another cool feature in the CSS that we can apply using 
 ```
 transition: box-shadow 0.15s;
 ```
6. **Transition Property**: We can only transit one property at a time, to do multiple we can insert the code 
```
Transition: all 0.15s;
```
7. **Max height**: It expands vertically, but won‚Äôt take up the whole height as the height component.
8. **Root**: ‚Äò/‚Äô in href leads to the root of the website.
9. **Duplicating Lines**: Duplicating multiple lines in VS code can be done via ‚Äòshift+alt+down‚Äô.
10. **Navigation Bar**: When we have to insert the icon on the extreme left and other items to the left we can use the property justify-content and assign it to the space between.
11. **Cursors**: If we want to change the display of the cursor to a pointer, simply use cursor: pointer.

That was all for this blog! 

Until next time üôÇ
