## Another Day, Same Challenge

Practice! Practice! All you need is practice!
Continuing with my assignment of cloning skriper website, I am just very close to the actual output! But there are some issues that hinder me from achieving it which are discussed below:
the issues I face during the development:

1. When I tend to add multiple media queries for example one with max-width 390px and another with 786 px neither of them shows up!

2. Hover Effects: I am using the code
``` 
.navbar-icon:hover: 
Color: white; 
```
It still does not work! 
My google friend too is not able to help me with these issues ðŸ˜¥
Else everything meets the expectations!

PS: Have made some differences too in the website :
1. Background color of my website is black and the original website is a bit lighter than black!
2. Tagline!
That was all for the day!!

See you soon, hopefully with a full website tomorrow!
