## Let's Test Our Skills

“Done is better than perfect.”
–  Sheryl Sandberg

Hey! Back to share my journey!

To test my skills in DOM, my mentor gave me the assignment of completing two tests one from W3Schools and the other from LinkedIn, along with 13 practice exercises. 
It was given on Wednesday and the deadline was today, the 5th day of May. I started off with the exercises. On the first day, I was able to complete my first five exercises and their links will be shared in the blog. 

So, talking about the test. I scored 92% in W3Schools, it was relatively easy as it included the theoretical questions only. In the LinkedIn test, I earned the badge of “top 5% of 2.4M”. This test was mostly about the codes and picking up the most expected output of the code. But it went well and I got confident in my JavaScript skills. 

Moving on to the exercises, I was able to complete 9/13 all by myself but four weren’t done up till the deadline. Out of four, I wrote the code of two but it wasn’t working as expected, and for the other two I had absolutely no idea. Here are the links to all the exercises:

**Exercise 1: Modify the style of the paragraph text through javascript code.**
