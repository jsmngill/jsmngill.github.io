## Finally, the journey of the developer starts today!
Today marks the date where I will be heading to make my first self-handed website by my own. Thought of the so many project ideas and finally got one to kick start the journey. I decided to name my web application ImageForge. 


Wondering what ImageForge is?? Here we goo!!

Image Forge, an image generation website inspired by chatGPT, aims to offer consumers the best image generation platform with a single click. The current picture creation websites are unable to offer consumers a wide selection of realistic, high-quality images that are customizable and match their individual needs. 
In order to create aesthetically appealing photographs, users frequently struggle to discover an effective and user-friendly platform that provides a large selection of image categories, styles, and modification possibilities. 
Additionally, the current platforms might not make use of the most recent developments in AI and machine learning algorithms, which would limit innovation and produce an output of poor quality. In order to overcome these obstacles and offer consumers a user-friendly, all-inclusive platform to quickly create high-quality, customizable photos, image forge was created.

Started with the idea will share the final output with you all!
