## Here we go with REACT!
Tadaaa!

Back with another episode of learning, experiencing web development. Today I will walk you through the new valuable library in the front-end development “REACT”. 
React is basically a popular JavaScript library used for building dynamic user interfaces for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and has gained widespread adoption due to its simplicity, flexibility, and performance. In this blog, we'll take a closer look at React and explore some of its key features.


React makes use of a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. This allows React to make updates to the DOM more efficiently, resulting in faster performance and a better user experience.

Key Features:

1. JSX: JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. This makes it easier to create and manage components, as it allows for a more intuitive and streamlined development process. JSX also allows developers to use JavaScript expressions within HTML-like code, making it possible to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

2. Components: Components are reusable building blocks that can be combined to create complex interfaces. Components can be written as functions or classes, and they can have their own state and lifecycle methods. This makes it possible to create complex and interactive user interfaces that are easy to manage and maintain.
 
3. Virtual DOM: The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM, which allows React to make updates to the DOM more efficiently. When a component's state changes, React updates the virtual DOM and then compares it to the previous version. It then only updates the parts of the actual DOM that have changed, resulting in faster performance and a better user experience.
 
4. Typescript: Typescript is a superset of Javascript that adds static typing to JavaScript. 
 
5. Vanilla JS: Vanilla JS is a term used to describe using pure, unaltered JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks. It refers to the practice of writing JavaScript code using only the language itself, without relying on any third-party tools or frameworks. Vanilla JS is often used by developers who want to build small, lightweight applications or who prefer to have complete control over their code.
 
I have mentioned earlier that it is a library, not a framework. So, Library is a tool that provides specific functionality whereas a framework like Angular is something that provides tools and guidelines for building apps. 

There is so much to learn and evolve. To make this concept more clearer, I will be sharing my end project with you all.

Till then, wishing you great time!!
