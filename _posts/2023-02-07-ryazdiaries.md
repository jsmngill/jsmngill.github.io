## Getting Experience!

***“Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.”

Finally, I was able to deploy my website on netlify with so many ups and downs, many a time felt like leaving but this is different from what we learned throughout the years of academics. I had made the website in a code along with Mosh, but this was made without any external help. During this phase, I learned a lot of things that were actually not taught in the course, from starting in a positive environment end up shutting down the laptop with disappointment, but this is what we learn as coders to be patient and never give up. So, in the previous blog, I have written about the issues in responsiveness, the solution was the size, the size was supposed to be different for that, and with some extra padding and margin the issue was resolved, it was so simple yet it took me almost a whole day to solve this, thankful for my mentor, who solved this in minutes. 

Here is the [link](https://genuine-florentine-d2de0f.netlify.app/) to my website.

Moreover, my mentor had assigned me to study the pull requests and branches in GitHub. So, here is a brief introduction to these topics:

1. **Braches**: There is always a main branch that is the default branch in git, but when in a professional workflow, where you need to tell the associates about your work side by side, or you are working on this particular part of the code. So, the branch is a parallel version, where we can add new code and work on it in isolation, then if it is in line with the expectations then we can send a pull request to merge it in the main branch.
2. **Pull Requests**: You can let people know about changes you've pushed to a branch in a GitHub repository by using pull requests. Before your modifications are merged into the basic branch, you can collaborate with others on a pull request, examine prospective adjustments, and contribute follow-up commits. 

Additionally, since I had issues with responsiveness, I was asked to know about the standard pixels for every device:
Here are the numbers:

320px — 480px: Mobile devices.

481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets.

769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops.

1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens.

1201px and more — Extra large screens, TV

That was all for the day!

Until Next! Bye!
