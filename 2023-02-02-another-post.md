##  Programmers, learn by doing!
***“Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it.”
– Patrick McKenzie***


It was the day to challenge the skills I have learned throughout the course. My mentor provided me with the assignment to clone Apple-Watch-Store-Landing-Page-Design provided by Figma. At first, it seemed pretty easy as it felt like I had done this already while developing the website in course 3 but still there were a number of challenges that I faced. But, as always my friend **Blossom** came to the rescue. Spent almost 40 minutes, figuring out the issues and getting the most probable solution. The issues that I was facing at first were: 

1.**Designing the vertical menu bar** (ironically, it was much easier than I expected but I spent almost a day and a half on it).

2.**Adding responsiveness** was yet another issue that was faced, I am quite clear with the basics of media query but somehow by applying the media query, the elements are overlapping each other (I will be working on this tomorrow).

3.There are some **padding issues** as well, which seek attention. 

There is much more to share, but will do once I am done with the task. I will share my website after deploying it. Personally, today I felt that coding will increase my patience level and would suggest that you should never leave the problem mid-way, work and work harder till you get the desired results.

**Remember, Programmers, learn by doing!**

till we meet again, virtually!
